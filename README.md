    Thio's Background App Notifier
</h1>

### A lightweight Windows tool that notifies you about new auto-starting background services and scheduled tasks, which Windows does not tell you about.

It does **not** run continuously, it's not a hypocrite. But you _can_ set it to quietly run once at each Windows startup, and it will show a message box if any new auto running items are found since last check. If not, it just closes.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not meant for security purposes or detecting apps actively trying to hide, nor does it determine whether an app is "good" or "bad". It just makes you *more* aware than before.

# How to Download

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ThioJoe/Thio-Background-App-Notifier/releases) page.
2. For the latest release, look under `Assets` and grab either:
    - **Installer**: The `.msi` — installs per-user or for all users. This will also allow it to be updated via `winget` later.
    - **Portable**: The standalone `Thio-Background-App-Notifier_*.exe` -- just run it, no install needed.

# What It Does (And Why?)

Many programs set themselves to launch at startup or daily without ever showing up in the normal Startup apps list. They register a **Windows Service** or a **Scheduled Task** instead, which run silently in the background and are easy to miss.

The first time you run it, it records a baseline of:
- Scheduled tasks that run at login
- Scheduled tasks that run daily
- Windows Services set to start Automatically

After that, whenever you open it (or let it check at logon), it tells you **what's new since you last looked** and highlights it.

It is **fully portable** (just one exe), but there is an _optional_ `.msi` installer, so you can keep it up to date via `winget`.

## What It Does _NOT_ Track (On Purpose)

It does **not** track "regular" startup apps, like ones that add themselves to your **Startup folder** or the **Run** registry keys. Because:

* **Windows already notifies you about those** via its built-in *"Startup app notifications"* setting.

   Recommended you turn this ON:

<p align="center">Settings ▸ System ▸ Notifications ▸ Startup app notifications</p>

* This app focuses on the categories Windows _doesn't_ warn you about, so the two complement each other.
* However, this app _can_ show you whether that Windows setting is currently On, and can even turn it on for you.


## It's Not a Background Process

**It only scans when you open it,** and exits when you close it.

If you want automatic checks, there's an optional *"Re-check on each Windows Startup"* toggle.
It scans silently and only pops up a notification **if** something new actually appeared, otherwise you never see it.

# How to Use

1. **Run it once to set your baseline.** The first launch just records everything currently set to auto-start — nothing is flagged as new yet.
2. **Open it again whenever you want to check.** It rescans and shows any auto-run Services or Scheduled Tasks that appeared since last time, highlighted in the list.
3. **Double-click any row** for full details (executable path, service start type, task triggers, when it was first detected, etc.).
4. Use **"All Startup Services"** or **"All Startup Tasks"** to browse *everything* currently set to run, not just the new stuff.
5. In either complete list, use **"Export CSV"** to save every row and column for use in Excel or another spreadsheet application.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q:** Does it run constantly in the background?
**A:** No. It only scans when you open it. The optional "Re-check at startup" does a single silent check at logon and then exits if there's nothing new.

### **Q:** Why doesn't it list my normal startup programs?
**A:** Because Windows already warns you about "normal" startup apps via its built-in "Startup app notifications." This tool covers the categories Windows *doesn't* (background Services and Scheduled Tasks). There may be other categories added in the future, but these are the big ones.

### **Q:** Why not just use Sysinternals Autoruns?
**A:** The point of this app is the notifications it gives. If you just want to see a complete list of all of them, Autoruns is still more complete.

### **Q:** Does it need administrator rights?
**A:** Not for normal scanning or the detection log. Some items you lack permission to read are simply skipped.

### **Q:** Does it change or remove any of my startup items?
**A:** No. It's read-only — it only *reports* what it finds. The only thing it writes is its own detection log and (optionally) its own startup shortcut.

### **Q:** Will this detect malware?
**A:** Possibly, but it's mainly intended for legitimate software with annoying startup practices. There are lots of other ways malware can hide that this app wouldn't catch.
